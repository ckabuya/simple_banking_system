# Simple Banking System
This is a simple banking system based on the project from Jetbrains Academy. It has four main stages:
* Stage 1: Understand the card anatomy - Find out what a credit card consists of.
* Stage 2: Implement Luhn Algorithm to check the card number for validity
* Stage 3: Create a database and store your data in it. JDBC, SQL
* Stage 4 : Advanced System - Improve your system by extending its functionality.

In this project
*how the banking system works 
*learn about SQL. 
*how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number.

#Implemented in Java
